              The Journey of an Aspiring Computer Scientist
            </h1>
            <h4>
              As a student, I've been diving into the world of web development, learning how to create websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
              It's been a fascinating journey, discovering how to bring ideas to life on the screen and make them interactive for users. 
              From choosing colors and layouts to writing code that makes buttons work, I've enjoyed every step of the process.
            </h4>
            <h4>
              In addition to my exploration of web development, I've developed a deeper understanding of programming languages like C and C++. 
              Understanding these languages has provided me with a solid foundation in computer science, enabling me to
               approach coding challenges with a deeper level of insight and precision.
            </h4>
            <h4>
              Every week, I dedicate time to solving 4 to 6 coding problems, striving to enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of programming. 
              Outside of coding, I find enjoyment and mental stimulation in playing chess, appreciating its blend of strategy and entertainment.
